                <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                <p>My interest in pursuing this course particularly manifests within the realm of cloud computing and infrastructure as a service. This development grants individuals with data centre like infrastructure without having to maintain physical servers and deal with the issues surrounding them. My question lies in whether current networking firewalls and security measures can adequately deal with ongoing threats of exploitation, given the many times large corporations have been hacked, and if not, what can be done, further than encryption, to increase the security of cloud based infrastructure. </p>
                <p>The advent of this interest came whilst studying Diagnostic Radiography, as I began to grow a fascination towards the ways in which crucial mass data sets relating to a plethora of patients was handled efficiently, and how such information could be accessed around the world if needed in emergencies. The introduction of the Raspberry Pi also furthered my interest in IT, as it provided tinkerers with a compact, bare-bones computer that could efficiently run most Linux distributions opening a virtually limitless world within the innovation sector, from small scale home-based devices to industrial applications. </p>
                <p>My decision to study at RMIT stemmed from my currently busy lifestyle, given that I am also a full time touring DJ and music producer. RMIT’s offering of a fully online collaborative course thoroughly fulfilled my requirements, not to mention the university’s prestigious stature among Australian based education institutions, being one of the top ranked. I am eager to gain further knowledge within this field and equip myself with the necessary skills and inspiration to work towards my own developments. </p>
                <p>During my studies I intend to learn all concepts and skills relevant to Information Technology and their impacts towards making contemporary society function in a more efficient manner, from daily life to broad scale applications, at the hands of new innovations. I particularly look forward to gaining an extensive understanding of about Cloud Computing software, the intricacies of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a paramount emphasis on security and networking. </p>

                <p>I was born and raised in Sydney, however I am of Indian origin, speaking both English and Hindi. I studied at Parramatta Marist High School, graduating in 2017, before going onto study a Bachelor of Applied Science (Diagnostic Radiography) at the University of Sydney until 2020. During this time I’d also pursed a career as an electronic musician, based primarily in Los Angeles until the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
