        <p>Myers-Briggs test: Virtuoso ISTP-T</p>
        <p>Online learning style test (training.com): Aural Learner&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>
        <p>Analytical Reasoning test: 90%<br></p>
        <p>The Myers-Briggs test renders me a Virtuoso, with a natural interest in problem solving and developing new innovations. I find great joy in trouble shooting and first hand experience, however I am a reserved individual who may struggle being assertive in collaborative scenarios. The online learning test indicates that I am an Aural learner, finding that I can most efficiently comprehend/analyse information that is presented in an aural format, however may find difficulty in presenting my own ideas aurally. Within the analytical reasoning test I completed I scored a 90%, with the average score being 68%, thus indicating that whilst I may be competent in seeking out solutions to problems analytically, I may succumb to time related pressures. I trust the validity of the former mentioned test results as the questions were specific and answered accurately.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These results infer that whilst I may struggle communicating ideas succinctly throughout collaborative efforts, I can work efficiently and diligently when assigned individual tasks and complete such to a high standard. I may also find myself trouble shooting the final product, ensuring that it is fault free and thoroughly fulfills all aspects of the criteria. I find comfort in being assigned specific tasks and find myself adhering to guidelines and making sure all requirements are met to a high standard. </p>
        <p>When forming a team it is crucial that I am working with individuals who can reciprocate my efforts and work intuitively, as well as offer abstract perspectives that may enhance the final product that I may not be able to bring forth on my own being mostly an analytical thinker. Being clearly assigned a role and specific goals is paramount in ensuring my efficiency as a collaborative partner, thus despite being hesitant to the concept of total leadership as of now, it is an area I intend to work on. </p>
